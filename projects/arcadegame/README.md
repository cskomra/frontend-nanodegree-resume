#The Bug Evaders Game 
<br>

##Starting the Game
To begin play, open the `index.html` file and a new game will begin.

##Basic Functionality
The Bug Evaders game includes one player and multiple enemies (*bugs*). The basic goal of the player is to reach the water without colliding into an enemy bug. 

###Three Game Levels
The game includes three levels.  At each consecutive level, enemy bugs move more quickly; and there are (at times) more of them.  Therefore, it gets more and more difficult to complete each level the farther the player continues in the game.  

###Three Lives
The player starts out with three lives at the beginning of the game.  Once the player collides with an enemy bug the player loses a life, is reset back to the start square, and the game continues.

###Navigating the Game Scene
You can move the player left, right, up, and down using the arrow keys on a computer keyboard.

Enemies move in various speeds on the paved block portion of the scene depending upon the current level of the game. 

###Losing the Game
If the player sustains three collisions prior to successfully completing all three levels, the player loses the game.

###Winning the Game
When the player reaches the water, the game level is incremented and the player is reset back to the start square.  ***The player wins the game by getting through all three levels***  **before** ***losing all three lives.***
